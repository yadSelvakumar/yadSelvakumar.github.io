title: Linearizing stochastic systems with the Koopman Operator

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: This paper provides an alternative computationally-efficient approach to approximate non- linear stochastic models. The novel method combines both perturbation and projection methods and draws on results from Koopman operator theory. I state convergence results and demonstrate its capabilities on a highly non-linear consumption- based asset-pricing model with external habits.
